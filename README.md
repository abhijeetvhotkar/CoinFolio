CoinFolio is a price tracking application for crypto money. 

It was written using Angular and Typescript with Ionic Framework.

The application runs cross-platform. You can run this app on both android and iOS devices.

I also plan to publish on the Google Play Store and the Apple Store when we make the app perform.

Your computer must have nodeJS, Ionic Framework and Cordova installed to run and develop the project.

First download and install NodeJS and follow the steps below.

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g cordova

$ sudo npm install -g ionic
```

If you want to test the application on your browser, follow the steps below.
